# Extraction and the finite mountain geometry

The extracted row keeps the geometric pseudo-parent forest as its candidate
forest. Its actual parents are computed by the same positive, nearest-smaller
selection as every numerical row. A selected parent has strictly smaller
height in the mountain from which it was extracted.
